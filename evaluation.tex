\subsection{Domains}

In this subsection, we describe the domains used in our experiments.

\begin{description}
\item[Biased Rock, Paper, Scissors] is a payoff-skewed version of the one-shot game Rock, Paper, Scissors shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:brps}. This game was introduced in \cite{Shafiei09}, and shown that the visit count distribution of 
DUCT does converge to a fixed balanced situation, but not one that 
corresponds to the optimal mixed strategy of $(\frac{1}{16},\frac{10}{16},\frac{5}{16})$.

\item[Goofspiel] is a card game where each player gets 13 cards marked 1-13, and there is a face down
point-card stack (also 1-13). Every turn, the {\it upcard} (top card of the point-card stack is turned face up,
Each player chooses a {\it bid} card from their hand simultaneously.
The player with the higher bid takes the upcard. The bid cards are then discarded and a new round starts.
At the end of 13 rounds, the player with the highest number of points wins, a tie ends in a draw.

\item[Oshi-Zumo]$(N,K,M)$ is a wrestling simulation game played on a discrete single-dimensional grid with
$2K+1$ positions, where each player starts with $N$ coins~\cite{buro2003}. A wrestler token begins in the middle
position. Every turn,
each player bids $b \ge M$ coins. The coins bid are then discarded and the player bidding the most coins pushes the
wrestler one position closer to the goal for that player. 

\item[Pursuit Evasion Games]

\item[Random/Synthetic Games]

\item[Tron] is a two-player game played on discrete grid possibly obstructed by walls. At each
step in Tron both players move to adjacent cells, and a wall is placed in the cells the players started on that turn.
Both players try to survive as long as possible. If both players can only move into a wall, can only move off the board or move into each other at the same turn, the game ends  in a draw.
